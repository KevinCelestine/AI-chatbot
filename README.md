# AI-chatbot
Abstraction
        In the realm of text-based chat, our chatbot leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including machine learning algorithms and deep learning models, to comprehend and generate human-like responses. Through continuous learning from user interactions, the chatbot adapts its responses to individual preferences and contextual nuances, enhancing the conversational experience.
	For image-based chat interactions, our chatbot integrates computer vision technologies to interpret visual input and extract relevant information. By analyzing images through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and feature extraction algorithms, the chatbot identifies objects, scenes, and contextual cues, enabling it to generate appropriate responses or perform tasks based on visual stimuli.
	In voice-based chat interactions, our chatbot employs automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU) techniques to transcribe spoken words into text and comprehend the user's intent and context. By utilizing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and attention mechanisms, the chatbot processes voice inputs in real-time, delivering accurate and contextually relevant responses through synthesized speech.

Achievements
